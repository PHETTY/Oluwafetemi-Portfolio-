    <p class="card-text1">As a designer, I always put the needs of the users first. In order to create designs that are truly useful and effective, it's essential to understand their preferences and behaviors. That's why I conduct thorough research to gain insights into their needs and desires. Whether it's through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews, I'm committed to gathering as much information as possible to inform my design decisions. By truly understanding the people who will be using my designs, I can create products that are intuitive, user-friendly, and meet their needs in the best possible way.
